    <p>One month ago, Dead Rooster was in Barcelona for the Primavera Festival. This
very friday, in the middle afternoon, Joe Gantdelaine and I were sitting in the
Parc Central del Poblenou, a satellite stage of the festival. There, we have
grass rather than concrete but unexplicably, the vast majority of the festival
audience snubs it. A San Miguel cup in hand, comfortably seated in plastic
garden chairs, in the shade of the surrounding trees, we watched the concert of
the Fresh &amp; Onlys, the authors of the recent <em>Play It Strange</em>. The concert
convinced us to get it.</p>
<p>The record starts with a charming lightness song, <em>Summer Of Love</em>. Clean
guitars and heavy reverb for the lead singing voice makes it an easy and
seducing introduction, in an atmosphere caribbeanized by organs, xylophones and
bongas. The second track is a different gear: high-pitched vocals, the bass
leads the way while the guitar keeps playing this simple but terrific riff that
concludes the best song of the album, <em>Waterfall</em>, <a href="/compile-mp3-du-net-03/">that you might have already
seen here</a>.</p>

<p>If Lee Mavers was twenty years younger, was taking anti-depressants and Frosties
for breakfast, was born in San Fransico and spent more time at the beach, The
La’s would be called The Fresh &amp; Onlys. Of course, the comparison is completely
stupid, but let’s face it: same taste for the coolest possible folk (<em>Until The
End Of Time</em>, <em>Red Light, Green Light</em>), same mix of perfect pop songs
(<em>Waterfall</em> for sure, but <em>Be My Hooker</em> and <em>Plague Of Frogs</em> as well) and
epic titles (<em>Tropical Island Suite</em>).</p>

<p>It may sound too wise to be a great record, but Fresh &amp; Onlys can also be weird
and crazy as in <em>Who Needs A Man</em>, which does make <em>Play It Strange</em> the best
record we’ve listened to for a while. And, unlike The La’s, The Fresh &amp; Onlys
release a lot of stuff : <em>Play It Strange</em> is already the third album of the
band. We should try to get <em>The Fresh &amp; Onlys</em> and <em>Grey-Eyed Girls</em>, the two
previous albums, as fast as we can.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by this nice anecdote about the fact that <a href="/plaidoyer-en-faveur-du-retour-du-disque-vinyle/">people should buy
vinyle records again</a>. Plus it proves the band is really cool. A few
minutes after the concert ended, i went close to the stage to ask the band if
they could sell me their record. The guitarist nodded and gave me the 12” record
saying: “we sell these 20 euros at the festival but right now, just name your
price and it will be fine”. The deal was set for 12 euros, MP3-download-coupon
and hand-shake included.</p>
